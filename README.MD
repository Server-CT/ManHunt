# How 2 play

A game will start automatically when online players count to reach the value you set.  
The `runner` selected by voting and other players will be hunters.  
When the ender dragon died, the runner wins.  
But if the Runner died, the hunters win. So, the hunters' goal is to find the runner and kill him. we gave some tools to
hunters to achieve their goal,  `A compass which tracks runner`  
The runner has their radars, too. When a hunter attempted to approach him, he will receive a warning message.
